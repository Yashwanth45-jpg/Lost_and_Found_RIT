# ðŸŽ’ Lost & Found - RIT

A collaborative web platform to help students and staff at RIT report, search for, and recover lost items on campus.  
Our goal is to create a simple and efficient system where users can quickly post lost or found items and connect with others to return belongings to their rightful owners.
